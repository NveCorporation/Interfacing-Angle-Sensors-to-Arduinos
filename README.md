# Interfacing-Angle-Sensors-to-Arduinos
Typical "AAT" angle sensor to Arduino interfaces.
No amplification is needed because of the large output signals from these sensors.

"AAT-Output-to-Meter-3digit" is a basic 3-digit interface.

"AAT-Output-to-Meter-4digit" 
is a high-precision four-digit analog output (+-180.0 mV) from an NVE AAT003 angle sensor.
Has calibration for sensitivity and offset. 
Sensor SIN output on pin 4; COS on pin 5; +analog output on pin 10; -out on 9.
